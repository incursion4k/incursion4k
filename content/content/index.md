# About

My name is Martin and I am doing some studies in DevOps, I am doing this to help integrate it into my current knowledge base of IT systems and Softwares. I am returning to my studies after a long period of time away and in a completely different field.

I am very interested in Computer Science and its possibilities and have always been fascinated since I was young. The simple logic and 'computers do what you tell them' process has always fascinated me and I have enjoyed helping others achieve their goals with computing.  

I currently work in IT support, however this is more directed into the communication part of the field rather than the computing, this is a an area I would like to get back into, hence my interest in the DevOps CS-EJ4104 course right now.
