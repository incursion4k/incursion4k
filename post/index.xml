      <description>The DevOps Course - CS-EJ4104 at Aalto University Reasons why I decided to take the DevOps Course - CS-EJ4104: and expectations:
 I am very interested in Computing Studies in general and wanted to get overall view of some of the newer fundamentals in computing science since I originally studied the subject back in 2004-2008. I have some background knowledge in coding, however this is totally different to what I was used to and once I gain further understanding I will be able to apply these learnings to future projects and gains in my studies and professional life.</description>

      <description>#Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and things I&amp;rsquo;m still learning/practicing:
 Git / Github - I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt what Git is and does: How it manages version controls in a streamlined way which allows collaborators to implement and deploy new changes quickly, whilst maintaining the ability to revert back to a previous working form. The resilience in this kind of technology cannot be overstated. It is the biggest, best way to manage changes I have seen in nearly 2 decades.</description>
